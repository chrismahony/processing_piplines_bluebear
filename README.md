# Bulk and scRNAseq processing piplines


## For Croft lab- UoB (using BlueBear HPC)

This repository includes workflows for various analyses with easy work flows to follow and insctructions to run.

Just select the type of analysis you need to do:



## Downloading data and preprocessing

1. Downloading data from Novogene: [dowloand_data_novogene/README.md](https://github.com/chrismahony/processing_piplines_bluebear/tree/main/dowloand_data_novogene)



2. Processing bulk RNAseq: https://github.com/chrismahony/processing_piplines_bluebear/tree/main/process_bulk_RNAseq



3. Processing scRNAseq data: https://github.com/chrismahony/processing_piplines_bluebear/tree/main/process_scRNAseq




## Analysing data (R)

1. Analysing bulk RNAseq (R):
